[LOO-kee-ah]-[YOO-lee-ah]-[LEE-boh]

- Species: Dragon
- Sex: Female

Lucia Julia Libo, or Julia for short, is a rare and formidable Dracomorph born during the Roman Republic era. Her species is the result of a human and dragon intermingling, granting her extraordinary abilities in both her humanoid and draconic forms.

In her human guise, Julia presents a stunning appearance with jet-black tresses and emerald eyes that seem to sparkle with inner fire. She dons light metal armor crafted from a unique material known as Draconic steel, which she herself contributed by using her own dragon scales in its forging process. This bespoke armor bears a subtle pink hue, offering enhanced protection that only affects Julia. Her nails, like her tail's tip, possess the same potent venom, although in smaller doses that induce weakness and nausea unless consumed in excess, at which point they become lethally toxic.

As a large, dark pink wyvern in her draconic manifestation, Julia exudes a commanding presence. She wields two distinct breath weapons - lightning and fire - which she can switch between at will. Her tail terminates in a sharp, venomous spike capable of injecting a debilitating toxin that, while initially harmless in small amounts, becomes deadly if ingested in sufficient quantities.

Julia's flesh, whether in her human or draconic state, is incredibly resilient, only vulnerable to penetration by weapons forged from the now-lost art of Draconic steel. Her unyielding nature is complemented by a pragmatic approach to killing, reserving it for situations deemed necessary.
