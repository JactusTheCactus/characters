# Maria Metaxa (Μαρία Μεταξά)

[ma-REE-ah]-[may-ta-KSA]

- Species: High-Tier Pred
- Sex: Female

Maria's human friends often find themselves in precarious situations when they first cross paths with her. Her predatory instincts are keen, and the scent of fresh Prey can be overwhelming. However, something within her, a spark of recognition or a glimmer of connection, often stays her fangs and turns her attention from hunger to companionship.

Perhaps it's the unique sparkle in a friend's eyes, the infectious laughter that echoes through a crowded room, or the quiet strength that radiates from a confident individual. Whatever the catalyst, Maria is drawn to these qualities, finding herself wanting to know more, to understand the essence of what makes her potential prey so compelling.

As she forges these bonds, Maria learns to temper her predatory nature with empathy and understanding. She comes to appreciate the complexity of human relationships, the depth of emotional connections, and the richness of shared experiences. In turn, her friends discover a multifaceted creature, one whose allure is as much about the danger she represents as the warmth and loyalty she can offer.

Attributes that define Maria include her striking beauty, her sharp intellect, her air of mystery, her status as a high-tier Pred, her capacity for both ruthless hunger and genuine connection, and her ability to form deep, meaningful relationships with humans despite her predatory nature.
